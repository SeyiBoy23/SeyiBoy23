## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a Mathematics graduate with a BSc (Hons) from the University of Dundee and an MSc in Mathematical Biology, Ecology, and Medicine from Heriot-Watt University. I have a strong foundation in mathematical and statistical analysis, combined with hands-on experience in operations analysis, data-driven decision-making, and project management.

My technical skills include proficiency in Python, SQL, and Microsoft Power BI and ongoing training in machine learning, deep learning, and AWS. I am passionate about leveraging these skills to drive operational efficiency and provide innovative data solutions.

Previously, I worked as an Operations Analyst at Morgan Stanley, managing the end-to-end trade life cycle, resolving discrepancies, and leading projects to improve system efficiencies. My role required strong problem-solving abilities, attention to detail, and the ability to collaborate effectively with technology teams and clients.

In addition to my professional experience, I have been actively involved in volunteer work, assisting with mathematics mentoring and supporting educational activities for young students. This has enhanced my leadership, communication, and teamwork skills.

I am seeking new opportunities in data analysis, data science, and related fields where I can apply my analytical skills and interdisciplinary expertise to make a significant impact. I am dedicated, reliable, and eager to take on new challenges.

I look forward to connecting and exploring how we can achieve remarkable results together.
